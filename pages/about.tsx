                <p>The aim of this project is to make access to crystal
                        structure data as easy as possible.</p>
                    <p>A huge amount of empirical crystallographic
                        information was collected during decades and it is
                        crucial for chemist, biologists, physicists, materials
                        scientists as well as for engineers.
                        The data is scattered in multiple databases,
                        while the best ones are not free.
                        Straightforward access and efficient search in
                        large arrays of data is a necessary part of the scientific
                        infrastructure, which is beneficial to everyone and
                        stimulate the scientific and technological advances.</p>
                    <p>This project aims improvements of this infrastructure
                        and as a first step, a web-interface is created for search in the

                        Crystallography Open Database (COD)</a>.</p>
                    <p>We hope that the project will evolve with the help of our
                        emerging community.</p>
